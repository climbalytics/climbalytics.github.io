Basically, this \"thing\" that I build cannot impede your wrist movement. Many of you shared that you don't wear any type of jewelery while climbing because it makes it harder to perform well and it's a safety hazard if it gets caught on a rock. I totally agree. Based on this feedback I'm thinking of adjusting the design so that it's less like a watch and more like the soft, snug type of sweat wristband (you know the kind that Tennis players wear?). The advantage of this form factor is twofold. First, it should give you more range of motion in your wrist than if you were wearing a watch. Second, if it gets caught on a rock it will just slip off your wrist, rather than causing an injury. I'd love your thoughts on this idea.

RFID is extremely accurate and is used for lots of other purposes including tracking inventory within a store and keeping track of where different medications go within a hospital.
